# Bitcoin Merchant starter kit

The purpose of this project is to provide awareness of how merchants can accept Bitcoin payments.

There are multiple ways of doing this. At the easiest and quickest way, we recommend using mobile wallets.

## Mobile Wallets

* [Breez Wallet](https://breez.technology/) - For accepting **Bitcoin Lightning** payments.
* [Coinnomi Wallet](https://www.coinomi.com/en/) - For accepting **on chain** payments

## Server Based

With a repurposed laptop or Raspberry PI with at least 600 GB worth of space, I recommend using the [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com) project.

This requires a little bit of technical chops, but it offers the best first class experience for bitcoin and lightning users.

## Processing the payment and Integration

The best thing to do with existing point of sale systems is to treat this as a CASH sale. I've set up 2 businesses for this and they do this already. The only difference is the cash does not get stored in the till, and the use of an additional app.

## Offloading the coins

We recommend due to the low volume of transactions and the potential of them increasing in value, that you hold on to the coins. Think of it as small savings.

The next best option would be to use [nexo](https://nexo.io) to obtain a cash loan based on your crypto assets to manage cashflow.

Otherwise, you may also use an exchange such as [Binance](https://binance.com/) to convert the coins over to USDC or USDT where you can sell it locally. Or engage someone in the local community on advise.
